		<label> CMSC 150! <label>
		<br>
		<p>Favorite GE subject so far? </p>
		<p> KASAYSAYAN 1 with Panginoong Ma'am beng Boro-Magbanua.Because she does'nt teach the subject for the memorization of facts but for the appreciation of Philippine history that is not often taught in other history class that focuses Spanish colonization.</p>
		<br>
	 	<h3> Favorite Programming Language</h3>
	 	<p>Java because it's an object oriented class and it doesn't deal much with pointers and memory allocation</p>
	 	<h4> How is your Holiday/Semestral Break?</h4>

	 	<h4> How is your experience with the recent Taal Volcano eruption?</h4>
	 	<br>
	 	<p>Horrible.I didn't realize there was ashfall until it was reported on the news. Finding facemask was hard because most of the stores are sold out and I experienced asthma just by going out for a few minutes. n</p>
